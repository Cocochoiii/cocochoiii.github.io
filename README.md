# Coco Cai — Interactive Portfolio

This is a Create React App–based portfolio customized from your template. It includes:
- Updated copy (name, roles, skills, projects)
- Placeholder assets so it runs out-of-the-box
- Safer contact form + optional Mailchimp

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> Optional: run the email server for the contact form:
```bash
node server.js
```

## Where to edit
- **src/components/Banner.js** — headline/roles/intro
- **src/components/Projects.js** — project cards
- **src/components/Skills.js** — skill clusters
- **src/components/NavBar.js** — social links (TODO: replace placeholders)
- **src/components/Contact.js** — API endpoint or email settings
- **src/App.css** — colors, fonts, and backgrounds
